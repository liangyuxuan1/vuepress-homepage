# Introduction

During my summer internship in 2021, I learned a lot of new knowledge and skills. The configuration of the deep learning environment took me a lot of time from the beginning of using a laptop to replacing it with a workstation. I write down these configuration notes as a memo for the very likely need to repeat these tasks in the future.
